# Whats New
Issue 1: Black screen on Android LG V20 while the Game Scene view does work from inside the Unity Editor.
Issue 1 Correction: commented out lines in TriggerAnimation Script that were making screen go black.

Completed Globe Animation. Globe spins when clicked on.
Issue 2: Teleporter was interfering with Globe Animation Trigger Events.
Issue 2 Correction: disabled most of the teleporters and moved the enabled teleporter away from the Globe.

Moved the furniture to be pinned to the floor and walls where appropriate.
Learned how to navigate Udacity better so I can zoom in / out and move / pin game objects as needed.
