# Issues
All old code issues (black screen) were corrected with online session with Martin in February.
This project has been completed since early February and waiting for udacity review.
The udacity project 2 submission form has been blocking this project from being reviewed since early february 2017 - 
all email support and online support re: the project 2 udacity form submission has not been able to resolve the issues with
Udacity website as of March 4th 2017. Never ending loop of time wasting support requests that still continue
to block this project from being reviewed for completion.
